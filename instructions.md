This project is a trivia themed  game for my mother's 80th birthday party.  The game will be run on a mobile phone or device and be hosted on a website that runs off of this computer.  The game should be include 10 multiple choice questions that could be drawn from the 1940s_trivia_questions.md file in the same directory as these instructions.  The player will be presented with 10 randomly chosen questions.  After each question the player is shown the correct answer and the most frequently chosen answer.  At the end there will be an opportunity for the player to enter their name and then a scoreboard or histogram showing how all the players did.    The game should include simple graphics appropriate for a birthday party and possibly sounds.    Feel free to iterate on this concept.  I plan to add other decades as well.
